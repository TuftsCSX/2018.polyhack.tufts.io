							TL;DR: Bring a friend and plan to stay the night<br/>

							Hack? Is this legal?
						</div>
						<ul>
						<div class="lists">
						<li>"Hacking" has a bad rep in the media, but here we're talking about making something cool in a short amount of time with limited resources (think "life hack")</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="cheatheader">
							Gear:
						</div>
						<div class="lists">
						<ul>
						<li>A friend (preferably at a similar skill level)</li>
						<li>Toothbrush, computer, charger, comfortable clothes, your brain</li>
						<li>Optional: extension cord, dry erase marker, sticky notes, pen + paper (we will have some at the event, but may not be able to give to everyone), change of clothes</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="cheatheader">
							Designer vs Hacker?
						</div>
						<div class="lists">
						<ul>
						<li>It usually takes longer to build the tech than to design, so we will also have design competitions and events at night to keep designers on their toes</li>
						<li>The best designer will have a 1:1 portfolio review with a Facebook desinger. The top five designs will be submitted to Facebook for them to pick a winner</li>
						<li>You can be a hacker or designer and still submit to the design contests</li>
						<li>All design competition submissions must be designed at Tufts Polyhack</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="cheatheader">
							What kind of projects can I make?
						</div>
						<div class="lists">
						<ul>
						<li>Anything! Everything from a website that tells your grandma to get off the computer to your own programming language</li>
						<li>A lot of the best projects are either really serious and impressive, really creative, or really funny jokes #trolls</li>
						</ul>
						</div>
						<br>
						<div class="cheatheader">
							How do prizes work?
						</div>
						<div class="lists">
						<ul>
						<li>First Place and Runner Up: decided by the organizers + sponsors</li>
						<li>Sponsor Specific Awards: best use case of their API</li>
						<li>People's Choice: We will have a voting system after the event for people to choose the project they liked the most but that didn't get an award</li>
						<li>Accolades: the organizers have picked a handful of badges for outstanding projects</li>
						<li>Designers: There are prizes throughout the night specifically for you guys</li>

							RESUME??! AHHHH kbye
